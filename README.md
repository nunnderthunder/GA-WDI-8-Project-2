# GA-WDI-8-Project-2
First full stack project using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.
This is a simple blog for a friend of mine who is an Economics major from UGA that wished
to give advice aimed at college aged students who are less likely to be informed on proper
best practices when dealing with credit/finance situations.
